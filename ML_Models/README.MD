# Pre-trained ML Models
This repository includes four pre-trained ML models:
* Two classical models, **linear regression** and **random forest**, which users can easily apply using the provided Python code.
* Two advanced graph neural network (GNN) models, the **Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (CGCNN)** and the **Atomistic Line Graph Neural Network (ALIGNN)**.

For those interested in delving deeper into the capabilities of the GNN models, we recommend visiting the following repositories for additional insights and applications:
* [CGCNN](https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn) (Tian Xie and Jeffrey C. Grossman, _Physical Review Letters_, 2018)
* [ALIGNN](https://github.com/usnistgov/alignn.git) (Kamal Choudhary and Brian DeCost, _npj Computational Materials_, 2021)
